              "'\\n\\n\\nIn common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth\\'s climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth\\'s climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth\\'s lower atmosphere, causing global warming.\\nDue to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[7] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[8] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.[9]\\nClimate change threatens people with food and water scarcity, increased flooding, extreme heat, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result.[10] The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[11] Communities may adapt to climate change through efforts like coastline protection or expanding access to air conditioning, but some impacts are unavoidable. Poorer countries are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet they have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.\\nMany climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2\\xa0°C (2.2\\xa0°F) level of warming. Additional warming will increase these impacts and may trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.[12] Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2\\xa0°C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7\\xa0°C (4.9\\xa0°F) by the end of the century.[13] Limiting warming to 1.5\\xa0°C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.[14]\\nReducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels. This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants, vastly increasing use of wind, solar, and other types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use. Electricity generated from non-carbon-emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities.[16][17] Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and by farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.[18]\\nBefore the 1980s, when it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases were stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution, scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate.[19]\\nIn the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common. Though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably,[20] scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, and climate change describes the full effect of greenhouse gases on Earth\\'s climate system.[19] Global warming—used as early as 1975[21]—became the more popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S. Senate.[22] Since the 2000s, climate change has increased in usage.[23] Climate change can also refer more broadly to both human-caused changes or natural changes throughout Earth\\'s history.[24]\\nVarious scientists, politicians and media now use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and global heating instead of global warming.[25]\\nMultiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming.[28] The 2011–2020 decade warmed to an average 1.09\\xa0°C [0.95–1.20\\xa0°C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900).[29] Surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2\\xa0°C per decade,[30] with 2020 reaching a temperature of 1.2\\xa0°C above the pre-industrial era.[31] Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased.[32]\\nThere was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century. Climate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores.[33] Thermometer records began to provide global coverage around 1850.[34] Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, did not occur at the same time across different regions. Temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions.[35] There have been prehistorical episodes of global warming, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum.[36] However, the modern observed rise in temperature and CO2 concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events in Earth\\'s history do not approach current rates.[37]\\nEvidence of warming from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other observations.[38][39] For example, changes to the natural water cycle have been predicted and observed, such as an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity.[40] Flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring.[41] Another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth\\'s surface and preventing it from radiating into space.[42]\\nRegions of the world warm at differing rates. The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature.[43] This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation.[44] The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean.[45][46] The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.[47]\\nThe Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice. As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat.[48] Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming.[49] Arctic temperatures are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world.[50] Melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the Arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened Gulf Stream, further changing the climate.[51]\\nThe climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years (such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)), decades or even centuries.[52] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is \"external\" to the climate system, but not always external to the Earth.[53] Examples of external forcings include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun.[54]\\nTo determine the human contribution to climate change, known internal climate variability and natural external forcings need to be ruled out. A key approach is to determine unique \"fingerprints\" for all potential causes, then compare these fingerprints with observed patterns of climate change.[55] For example, solar forcing can be ruled out as a major cause. Its fingerprint would be warming in the entire atmosphere. Yet, only the lower atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing.[56] Attribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect.[57]\\nGreenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth\\'s surface. The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it. This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth\\'s surface and warming it over time.[63] Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33\\xa0°C warmer than it would have been in their absence.[64][65] While water vapour (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks. On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as CO2 (~20%), tropospheric ozone,[66] CFCs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore external forcings.[67]\\nHuman activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas),[68] has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a radiative imbalance. In 2019, the concentrations of CO2 and methane had increased by about 48% and 160%, respectively, since 1750.[69] These CO2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 2 million years. Concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800,000 years.[70]\\nGlobal anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59\\xa0billion tonnes of CO2. Of these emissions, 75% was CO2, 18% was methane, 4% was nitrous oxide, and 2% was fluorinated gases.[71] CO2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity.[4] Additional CO2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the CO2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser.[72] Methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction.[73] Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser.[74]\\nDespite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth\\'s land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for CO2. Land-surface sink processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, remove about 29% of annual global CO2 emissions.[75] The ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process. First, CO2 dissolves in the surface water. Afterwards, the ocean\\'s overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean\\'s interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle. Over the last two decades, the world\\'s oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted CO2.[76]\\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also affects the climate on a large scale.[77] From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth\\'s surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming,[78] typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning.[79] Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.[80]\\nAerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation. They also have indirect effects on the Earth\\'s radiation budget. Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets.[81] They also reduce the growth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight.[82] Indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.[83]\\nWhile aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming. Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise.[84] Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2\\xa0°C by 2050.[85]\\nHumans change the Earth\\'s surface mainly to create more agricultural land. Today, agriculture takes up 34% of Earth\\'s land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.).[87] The amount of forested land continues to decrease, which is the main land use change that causes global warming.[88] Deforestation releases CO2 contained in trees when they are destroyed, plus it prevents those trees from absorbing more CO2 in the future.[18] The main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil (27%), logging to produce forestry/forest products (26%), short term shifting cultivation (24%), and wildfires (23%).[89]\\nLand use changes not only affect greenhouse gas emissions. The type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature. It impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns.[90] In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to a cooling effect.[90] Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.[91]\\nPhysical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity.[92] As the Sun is the Earth\\'s primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system.[83] Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites,[93] and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards.[83] There has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun\\'s energy reaching the Earth.[94] Further evidence for greenhouse gases causing global warming comes from measurements that show a warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), coupled with a cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere).[95] If solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, the troposphere and stratosphere would both warm.[56]\\nExplosive volcanic eruptions represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era. When the eruption is sufficiently strong (with sulfur dioxide reaching the stratosphere), sunlight can be partially blocked for a couple of years. The temperature signal lasts about twice as long. In the industrial era, volcanic activity has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends.[96] Present-day volcanic CO2 emissions are equivalent to less than 1% of current anthropogenic CO2 emissions.[97]\\nThe response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks: increased by \"self-reinforcing\" or \"positive\" feedbacks and reduced by \"balancing\" or \"negative\" feedbacks.[99] The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds.[100][101] The primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as Earth\\'s surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature.[102] In addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of CO2 on plant growth.[103] Uncertainty over feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions.[104]\\nAs the air is warmed by greenhouse gases, it can hold more moisture. Water vapour is a potent greenhouse gas, so this further heats the atmosphere.[100] If cloud cover increases, more sunlight will be reflected back into space, cooling the planet. If clouds become higher and thinner, they act as an insulator, reflecting heat from below back downwards and warming the planet.[105] The effect of clouds is the largest source of feedback uncertainty.[106]\\nAnother major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the Arctic, which reduces the reflectivity of the Earth\\'s surface.[107]\\nMore of the Sun\\'s energy is now absorbed in these regions, contributing to amplification of Arctic temperature changes.[108] Arctic amplification is also melting permafrost, which releases methane and CO2 into the atmosphere.[109] Climate change can also cause methane releases from wetlands, marine systems, and freshwater systems.[110] Overall, climate feedbacks are expected to become increasingly positive.[111]\\nAround half of human-caused CO2 emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans.[112] On land, elevated CO2 and an extended growing season have stimulated plant growth. Climate change increases droughts and heat waves that inhibit plant growth, which makes it uncertain whether this carbon sink will continue to grow in the future.[113] Soils contain large quantities of carbon and may release some when they heat up.[114] As more CO2 and heat are absorbed by the ocean, it acidifies, its circulation changes and phytoplankton takes up less carbon, decreasing the rate at which the ocean absorbs atmospheric carbon.[115] Overall, at higher CO2 concentrations the Earth will absorb a reduced fraction of our emissions.[116]\\nA climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect the climate system.[117] Models are used to calculate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks.[118][119] Models also include natural processes like changes in the Earth\\'s orbit, historical changes in the Sun\\'s activity, and volcanic forcing.[120] In addition to estimating future temperatures, they reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere.[121]\\nThe physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates.[122] Past models have underestimated the rate of Arctic shrinkage[123] and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase.[124] Sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models, but more recent models agree well with observations.[125] The 2017 United States-published National Climate Assessment notes that \"climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes\".[126]\\nA subset of climate models add societal factors to a simple physical climate model. These models simulate how population, economic growth, and energy use affect\\xa0– and interact with\\xa0– the physical climate. With this information, these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions. This is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future.[127][128] Depending on the socioeconomic scenario and the mitigation scenario, models produce atmospheric CO2 concentrations that range widely between 380 and 1400 ppm.[129]\\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report projects that global warming is very likely to reach 1.0\\xa0°C to 1.8\\xa0°C by the late 21st century under the very low GHG emissions scenario. In an intermediate scenario global warming would reach 2.1\\xa0°C to 3.5\\xa0°C, and 3.3\\xa0°C to 5.7\\xa0°C under the very high GHG emissions scenario.[130] These projections are based on climate models in combination with observations.[131]\\nThe remaining carbon budget is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases.[132] According to the IPCC, global warming can be kept below 1.5\\xa0°C with a two-thirds chance if emissions after 2018 do not exceed 420 or 570 gigatonnes of CO2. This corresponds to 10 to 13 years of current emissions. There are high uncertainties about the budget. For instance, it may be 100 gigatonnes of CO2 smaller due to methane release from permafrost and wetlands.[133] However, it is clear that fossil fuel resources are too abundant for shortages to be relied on to limit carbon emissions in the 21st century.[134]\\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly. Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations.[135] Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency.[136] Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia.[137] The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing,[138] and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming.[139] Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change.[140]\\nGlobal sea level is rising as a consequence of glacial melt, melt of the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and thermal expansion. Between 1993 and 2020, the rise increased over time, averaging 3.3\\xa0±\\xa00.3\\xa0mm per year.[142] Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by 61–110\\xa0cm.[143] Increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug Antarctic glacier outlets, risking a large melt of the ice sheet[144] and the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions.[145]\\nClimate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice.[146] While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5\\xa0°C degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2\\xa0°C.[147] Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to changes in ocean chemistry. An increase in dissolved CO2 is causing oceans to acidify.[148] In addition, oxygen levels are decreasing as oxygen is less soluble in warmer water.[149] Dead zones in the ocean, regions with very little oxygen, are expanding too.[150]\\nGreater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through ‘tipping points’—thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures are reduced.[151][152] An example is the collapse of West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, where a temperature rise of 1.5 to 2\\xa0°C may commit the ice sheets to melt, although the time scale of melt is uncertain and depends on future warming.[153][154] Some large-scale changes could occur over a short time period, such as a shutdown of certain ocean currents like the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).[155] Tipping points can also include irreversible damage to ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs.[156]\\nThe long-term effects of climate change on oceans include further ice melt, ocean warming, sea level rise, and ocean acidification.[157] On the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of climate change will be determined primarily by anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This is due to CO2\\'s long atmospheric lifetime.[158] Oceanic CO2 uptake is slow enough that ocean acidification will continue for hundreds to thousands of years.[159] These emissions are estimated to have prolonged the current interglacial period by at least 100,000 years.[160] Sea level rise will continue over many centuries, with an estimated rise of 2.3 metres per degree Celsius (4.2\\xa0ft/°F) after 2000 years.[161]\\nRecent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes.[162] Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening. However, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions. The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear.[163] Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics.[164] The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely.[165] Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species.[166]\\nThe oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land.[167] Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, harming a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds.[168] Ocean acidification makes it harder for marine calcifying organisms such as mussels, barnacles and corals to produce shells and skeletons; and heatwaves have bleached coral reefs.[169] Harmful algal blooms enhanced by climate change and eutrophication lower oxygen levels, disrupt food webs and cause great loss of marine life.[170] Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress. Almost half of global wetlands have disappeared due to climate change and other human impacts.[171]\\nEcological collapse. Coral bleaching from thermal stress has damaged the Great Barrier Reef and threatens coral reefs worldwide.[172]\\nExtreme weather. Drought and high temperatures worsened the 2020 bushfires in Australia.[173]\\nArctic warming. Permafrost thaws undermine infrastructure and release methane, a greenhouse gas.[109]\\nHabitat destruction. Many arctic animals rely on sea ice, which has been disappearing in a warming Arctic.[174]\\nPest propagation. Mild winters allow more pine beetles to survive to kill large swaths of forest.[175]\\nThe effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world. Impacts can now be observed on all continents and ocean regions,[177] with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk.[178] Continued warming has potentially “severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts” for people and ecosystems.[179] The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries.[180]\\nThe World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30\\u2009years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures.[181]\\nThe WHO has classified climate change as the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[182] Extreme weather leads to injury and loss of life,[183] and crop failures to undernutrition.[184] Various infectious diseases are more easily transmitted in a warmer climate, such as dengue fever and malaria.[185] Young children are the most vulnerable to food shortages. Both children and older people are vulnerable to extreme heat.[186] The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that between 2030 and 2050, climate change would cause around 250,000 additional deaths per year. They assessed deaths from heat exposure in elderly people, increases in diarrhea, malaria, dengue, coastal flooding, and childhood undernutrition.[187] Over 500,000 more adult deaths are projected yearly by 2050 due to reductions in food availability and quality.[188] By 2100, 50% to 75% of the global population may face climate conditions that are life-threatening due to combined effects of extreme heat and humidity.[189]\\nClimate change is affecting food security. It has caused reduction in global yields of maize, wheat, and soybeans between 1981 and 2010.[190] Future warming could further reduce global yields of major crops.[191] Crop production will probably be negatively affected in low-latitude countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative.[192] Up to an additional 183 million people worldwide, particularly those with lower incomes, are at risk of hunger as a consequence of these impacts.[193] Climate change also impacts fish populations. Globally, less will be available to be fished.[194] Regions dependent on glacier water, regions that are already dry, and small islands have a higher risk of water stress due to climate change.[195]\\nEconomic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences.[196] Climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality, and this trend is projected to continue.[197] Most of the severe impacts are expected in sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources[198], and South-East Asia.[199] The World Bank estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030.[200]\\nCurrent inequalities based on wealth and social status have worsened due to climate change.[201] Major difficulties in mitigating, adapting, and recovering to climate shocks are faced by marginalized people who have less control over resources.[202][198] Indigenous people, who are subsistent on their land and ecosystems, will face endangerment to their wellness and lifestyles due to climate change.[203] An expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in armed conflict has been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities.[204]\\nLow-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes flooding more common. Sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea.[205] This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu.[206] In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to.[207] With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in extremely hot and uninhabitable climates, similar to the current climate found in the Sahara.[208] These factors can drive environmental migration, both within and between countries.[10] More people are expected to be displaced because of sea level rise, extreme weather and conflict from increased competition over natural resources. Climate change may also increase vulnerability, leading to \"trapped populations\" who are not able to move due to a lack of resources.[209]\\nEnvironmental migration. Sparser rainfall leads to desertification that harms agriculture and can displace populations. Shown: Telly, Mali (2008).[210]\\nAgricultural changes. Droughts, rising temperatures, and extreme weather negatively impact agriculture. Shown: Texas, US (2013).[211]\\nTidal flooding. Sea-level rise increases flooding in low-lying coastal regions. Shown: Venice, Italy (2004).[212]\\nStorm intensification. Bangladesh after Cyclone Sidr (2007) is an example of catastrophic flooding from increased rainfall.[213]\\nHeat wave intensification. Events like the June 2019 European heat wave are becoming more common.[214]\\nClimate change can be mitigated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and by enhancing sinks that absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.[215] In order to limit global warming to less than 1.5\\xa0°C with a high likelihood of success, global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2\\xa0°C target.[133] This requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry.[216] The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that countries need to triple their pledges under the Paris Agreement within the next decade to limit global warming to 2\\xa0°C. An even greater level of reduction is required to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C goal.[217] With pledges made under the Agreement as of October 2021, global warming would still have a 66% chance of reaching about 2.7\\xa0°C (range: 2.2–3.2\\xa0°C) by the end of the century.[13]\\nAlthough there is no single pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2\\xa0°C,[218] most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions.[219] To reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities, changes would also be necessary in agriculture and forestry,[220] such as preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation.[221]\\nOther approaches to mitigating climate change have a higher level of risk. Scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5\\xa0°C typically project the large-scale use of carbon dioxide removal methods over the 21st century.[222] There are concerns, though, about over-reliance on these technologies, and environmental impacts.[223] Solar radiation management (SRM) is also a possible supplement to deep reductions in emissions. However, SRM would raise significant ethical and legal issues, and the risks are poorly understood.[224]\\nRenewable energy is key to limiting climate change.[226] Fossil fuels accounted for 80% of the world\\'s energy in 2018. The remaining share was split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind and solar power and geothermal energy).[227] That mix is projected to change significantly over the next 30 years.[219] Solar panels and onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in many locations.[228] Renewables represented 75% of all new electricity generation installed in 2019, nearly all solar and wind.[229] Other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply. However, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison.[230]\\nTo achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios. Investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050.[231][232]\\nElectricity would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport.[233]\\nIn transport, emissions can be reduced fast by a switch to electric vehicles.[234] Public transport and active transport (cycling and walking) also produce less CO2.[235] For shipping and flying, low-carbon fuels can be used to reduce emissions.[234] Heating would be increasingly decarbonised with technologies like heat pumps.[236]\\nThere are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy, including renewables. For wind and solar, there are environmental and land use concerns for new projects.[237] Wind and solar also produce energy intermittently and with seasonal variability. Traditionally, hydro dams with reservoirs and conventional power plants have been used when variable energy production is low. Going forward, battery storage can be expanded, energy demand and supply can be matched, and long-distance transmission can smooth variability of renewable outputs.[226] Bioenergy is often not carbon-neutral and may have negative consequences for food security.[238] The growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around nuclear waste, nuclear weapon proliferation, and accidents.[239][240] Hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed, and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns.[241]\\nLow-carbon energy improves human health by minimising climate change. It also has the near-term benefit of reducing air pollution deaths,[242] which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016.[243] Meeting the Paris Agreement goals that limit warming to a 2\\xa0°C increase could save about a million of those lives per year by 2050, whereas limiting global warming to 1.5\\xa0°C could save millions and simultaneously increase energy security and reduce poverty.[244]\\nReducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions.[245] If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development. It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimises carbon-intensive infrastructure development.[246] Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy.[247] Several COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain.[248]\\nStrategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector. In transport, passengers and freight can switch to more efficient travel modes, such as buses and trains, or use electric vehicles.[249] Industrial strategies to reduce energy demand include improving heating systems and motors, designing less energy-intensive products, and increasing product lifetimes.[250] In the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings, and higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting.[251] The use of technologies like heat pumps can also increase building energy efficiency.[252]\\n Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand.[253] A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two thirds from 2010 levels. These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production.[254]\\nOn the demand side, a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towards plant-based diets.[255] Eliminating the production of livestock for meat and dairy would eliminate about 3/4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use.[256] Livestock also occupy 37% of ice-free land area on Earth and consume feed from the 12% of land area used for crops, driving deforestation and land degradation.[257]\\nSteel and cement production are responsible for about 13% of industrial CO2 emissions. In these industries, carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production, so that reducing CO2 emissions requires research into alternative chemistries.[258]\\nNatural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels.[259] Reforestation and tree planting on non-forest lands are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns.[260] Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments.[261] Restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter (blue carbon).[262] When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems.[263]\\nWhere energy production or CO2-intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste CO2, the gas can be captured and stored instead of released to the atmosphere. Although its current use is limited in scale and expensive,[264] carbon capture and storage (CCS) may be able to play a significant role in limiting CO2 emissions by mid-century.[265] This technique, in combination with bio-energy (BECCS) can result in net negative emissions: CO2 is drawn from the atmosphere.[266] It remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques, such as BECCS, will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 1.5\\xa0°C. Policy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals.[267]\\nAdaptation is \"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects\".[268] Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of \"severe, widespread and irreversible\" impacts.[269] More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive.[268] The capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less.[270] The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow. Many countries have implemented adaptation policies. However, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance.[271]\\nAdaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at-risk areas, learning to live with increased flooding and protection. If that fails, managed retreat may be needed.[272] There are economic barriers for tackling dangerous heat impact. Avoiding strenuous work or having air conditioning is not possible for everybody.[273] In agriculture, adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets, diversification, erosion control and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate.[274] Insurance allows for risk-sharing, but is often difficult to get for people on lower incomes.[275] Education, migration and early warning systems can reduce climate vulnerability.[276]\\nEcosystems adapt to climate change, a process that can be supported by human intervention. By increasing connectivity between ecosystems, species can migrate to more favourable climate conditions. Species can also be introduced to areas acquiring a favorable climate. Protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas helps build resilience, making it easier for ecosystems to adapt. Many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems, also help humans adapt via ecosystem-based adaptation. For instance, restoration of natural fire regimes makes catastrophic fires less likely, and reduces human exposure. Giving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system, reducing flood risk. Restored forest acts as a carbon sink, but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts.[277]\\nThere are synergies and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation. Adaptation often offer short-term benefits, whereas mitigation has longer-term benefits.[278] Increased use of air conditioning allows people to better cope with heat, but increases energy demand. Compact urban development may lead to reduced emissions from transport and construction. At the same time, it may increase the urban heat island effect, leading to higher temperatures and increased exposure.[279] Increased food productivity has large benefits for both adaptation and mitigation.[280]\\nCountries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions. This raises questions about justice and fairness.[281] Climate change is strongly linked to sustainable development. Limiting global warming makes it easier to achieve sustainable development goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities. The connection is recognised in Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to \"take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\".[282] The goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation.[283]\\nThe geopolitics of climate change is complex. It has often been framed as a free-rider problem, in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from switching to a low-carbon economy themselves. This framing has been challenged. For instance, the benefits of a coal phase-out to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions.[284] Furthermore, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy, causing net exporters to face stranded assets: fossil fuels they cannot sell.[285]\\nA wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions. As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.[286] Carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems.[287] Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in.[288] Ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths.[289] Money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead.[290] More direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry.[291] Several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production.[292]\\nPolicy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality. For instance, wealthy nations responsible for the largest share of emissions would have to pay poorer countries to adapt.[293] As the use of fossil fuels is reduced, jobs in the sector are being lost. To achieve a just transition, these people would need to be retrained for other jobs. Communities with many fossil fuel workers would need additional investments.[294]\\nNearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).[296] The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.[297] As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained.[298] The UNFCCC does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do. Global emissions have risen since the UNFCCC was signed.[299] Its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations.[300]\\nThe 1997 Kyoto Protocol extended the UNFCCC and included legally binding commitments for most developed countries to limit their emissions.[301] During the negotiations, the G77 (representing developing countries) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to \"[take] the lead\" in reducing their emissions,[302] since developed countries contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Per-capita emissions were also still relatively low in developing countries and developing countries would need to emit more to meet their development needs.[303]\\nThe 2009 Copenhagen Accord has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals, and was rejected by poorer nations including the G77.[304] Associated parties aimed to limit the global temperature rise to below 2\\xa0°C.[305] The Accord set the goal of sending $100 billion per year to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and proposed the founding of the Green Climate Fund.[306] As of 2020[update], the fund has failed to reach its expected target, and risks a shrinkage in its funding.[307]\\nIn 2015 all UN countries negotiated the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming well below 2.0\\xa0°C and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under 1.5\\xa0°C.[308] The agreement replaced the Kyoto Protocol. Unlike Kyoto, no binding emission targets were set in the Paris Agreement. Instead, a set of procedures was made binding. Countries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years.[309] The Paris Agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported.[310] As of October 2021[update], 194 states and the European Union have signed the treaty and 191 states and the EU have ratified or acceded to the agreement.[311]\\nThe 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to stop emitting ozone-depleting gases, may have been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the Kyoto Protocol specifically designed to do so.[312] The 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol aims to reduce the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a group of powerful greenhouse gases which served as a replacement for banned ozone-depleting gases. This made the Montreal Protocol a stronger agreement against climate change.[313]\\nIn 2019, the United Kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency.[314] Other countries and jurisdictions followed suit.[315] That same year, the European Parliament declared a \"climate and environmental emergency\".[316] The European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050.[317] Major countries in Asia have made similar pledges: South Korea and Japan have committed to become carbon-neutral by 2050, and China by 2060.[318] In 2021, the European Commission released its “Fit for 55” legislation package, which contains guidelines for the car industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035.[319] While India has strong incentives for renewables, it also plans a significant expansion of coal in the country.[320]\\nAs of 2021, based on information from 48 national climate plans, which represent 40% of the parties to the Paris Agreement, estimated total greenhouse gas emissions will be 0.5% lower compared to 2010 levels, below the 45% or 25% reduction goals to limit global warming to 1.5\\xa0°C or 2\\xa0°C, respectively.[321]\\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia. The actors behind climate change denial form a well-funded and relatively coordinated coalition of fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists.[323] Like the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about scientific data and results.[324] Many who deny, dismiss, or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change are labelled as \"climate change skeptics\", which several scientists have noted is a misnomer.[325]\\nThere are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimise the negative impacts of climate change.[326] Manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a manufactured controversy: creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes.[327] Strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions,[328] and questioning the motives of individual scientists.[326] An echo chamber of climate-denying blogs and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change.[329]\\nClimate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s.[333] Due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion.[334] In popular culture, the climate fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006) focused on climate change.[333]\\nSignificant regional, gender, age and political differences exist in both public concern for, and understanding of, climate change. More highly educated people, and in some countries, women and younger people, were more likely to see climate change as a serious threat.[335] Partisan gaps also exist in many countries,[336] and countries with high CO2 emissions tend to be less concerned.[337] Views on causes of climate change vary widely between countries.[338] Concern has increased over time,[336] to the point where in 2021 a majority of citizens in many countries express a high level of worry about climate change, or view it as a global emergency.[339] Higher levels of worry are associated with stronger public support for policies that address climate change.[340]\\nClimate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change. They can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities.[341] Prominent demonstrations include the School Strike for Climate. In this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg.[342] Mass civil disobedience actions by groups like Extinction Rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport.[343] Litigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action from public institutions and companies. Activists also initiate lawsuits which target governments and demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws on climate change.[344] Lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies generally seek compensation for loss and damage.[345]\\nIn the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth\\'s temperature was higher than the sun\\'s energy alone could explain. Earth\\'s atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat. However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat, which in turn warms the planet.[347]\\nIn 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and that the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide (CO2). She concluded that \"An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature...\"[348][349]\\nStarting in 1859,[350] John Tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygen—together totaling 99% of dry air—are transparent to radiated heat. However, water vapour and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide absorb radiated heat and re-radiate that heat into the atmosphere. Tyndall proposed that changes in the concentrations of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past, including ice ages.[351]\\nSvante Arrhenius noted that water vapour in air continuously varied, but the CO2 concentration in air was influenced by long-term geological processes. Warming from increased CO2 levels would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying warming in a positive feedback loop. In 1896, he published the first climate model of its kind, projecting that halving CO2 levels could have produced a drop in temperature initiating an ice age. Arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling CO2 to be around 5–6\\xa0°C.[352] Other scientists were initially skeptical and believed that the greenhouse effect was saturated so that adding more CO2 would make no difference, and that the climate would be self-regulating.[353] Beginning in 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar published evidence that climate was warming and CO2 levels were rising,[354] but his calculations met the same objections.[353]\\nIn the 1950s, Gilbert Plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum. This model predicted that increasing CO2 levels would cause warming. Around the same time, Hans Suess found evidence that CO2 levels had been rising, and Roger Revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase. The two scientists subsequently helped Charles Keeling to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the \"Keeling Curve\".[353] Scientists alerted the public,[355] and the dangers were highlighted at James Hansen\\'s 1988 Congressional testimony.[22] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world\\'s governments, spurred interdisciplinary research.[356] As part of the IPCC reports, scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer-reviewed journal articles.[357]\\nThere is a near-complete scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities. As of 2019, agreement in recent literature reached over 99%.[358][359] No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.[360] Consensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change. National science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions.[361] The 2021 IPCC Assessment Report stated that it is \"unequivocal\" that climate change is caused by humans.[359]\\nFourth Assessment Report\\nFifth Assessment report\\n\\nSpecial Report: Global Warming of 1.5\\xa0°C\\nSpecial Report: Climate change and Land\\nSpecial Report: The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate\\nSixth Assessment Report\\n'"

              "['\\n\\n\\nIn common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth\\'s climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth\\'s climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth\\'s lower atmosphere, causing global warming.\\nDue to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[7] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[8] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.[9]\\nClimate change threatens people with food and water scarcity, increased flooding, extreme heat, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result.[10] The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[11] Communities may adapt to climate change through efforts like coastline protection or expanding access to air conditioning, but some impacts are unavoidable. Poorer countries are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet they have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.\\nMany climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2\\xa0°C (2.2\\xa0°F) level of warming. Additional warming will increase these impacts and may trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.[12] Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2\\xa0°C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7\\xa0°C (4.9\\xa0°F) by the end of the century.[13] Limiting warming to 1.5\\xa0°C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.[14]\\nReducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels. This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants, vastly increasing use of wind, solar, and other types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use. Electricity generated from non-carbon-emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities.[16][17] Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and by farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.[18]\\nBefore the 1980s, when it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases were stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution, scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate.[19]\\nIn the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common. Though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably,[20] scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, and climate change describes the full effect of greenhouse gases on Earth\\'s climate system.[19] Global warming—used as early as 1975[21]—became the more popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S. Senate.[22] Since the 2000s, climate change has increased in usage.[23] Climate change can also refer more broadly to both human-caused changes or natural changes throughout Earth\\'s history.[24]\\nVarious scientists, politicians and media now use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and global heating instead of global warming.[25]\\nMultiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming.[28] The 2011–2020 decade warmed to an average 1.09\\xa0°C [0.95–1.20\\xa0°C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900).[29] Surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2\\xa0°C per decade,[30] with 2020 reaching a temperature of 1.2\\xa0°C above the pre-industrial era.[31] Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased.[32]\\nThere was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century. Climate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores.[33] Thermometer records began to provide global coverage around 1850.[34] Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, did not occur at the same time across different regions. Temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions.[35] There have been prehistorical episodes of global warming, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum.[36] However, the modern observed rise in temperature and CO2 concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events in Earth\\'s history do not approach current rates.[37]\\nEvidence of warming from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other observations.[38][39] For example, changes to the natural water cycle have been predicted and observed, such as an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity.[40] Flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring.[41] Another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth\\'s surface and preventing it from radiating into space.[42]\\nRegions of the world warm at differing rates. The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature.[43] This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation.[44] The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean.[45][46] The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.[47]\\nThe Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice. As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat.[48] Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming.[49] Arctic temperatures are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world.[50] Melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the Arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened Gulf Stream, further changing the climate.[51]\\nThe climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years (such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)), decades or even centuries.[52] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is \"external\" to the climate system, but not always external to the Earth.[53] Examples of external forcings include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth\\'s orbit around the Sun.[54]\\nTo determine the human contribution to climate change, known internal climate variability and natural external forcings need to be ruled out. A key approach is to determine unique \"fingerprints\" for all potential causes, then compare these fingerprints with observed patterns of climate change.[55] For example, solar forcing can be ruled out as a major cause. Its fingerprint would be warming in the entire atmosphere. Yet, only the lower atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing.[56] Attribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect.[57]\\nGreenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth\\'s surface. The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it. This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth\\'s surface and warming it over time.[63] Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33\\xa0°C warmer than it would have been in their absence.[64][65] While water vapour (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks. On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as CO2 (~20%), tropospheric ozone,[66] CFCs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore external forcings.[67]\\nHuman activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas),[68] has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a radiative imbalance. In 2019, the concentrations of CO2 and methane had increased by about 48% and 160%, respectively, since 1750.[69] These CO2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 2 million years. Concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800,000 years.[70]\\nGlobal anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59\\xa0billion tonnes of CO2. Of these emissions, 75% was CO2, 18% was methane, 4% was nitrous oxide, and 2% was fluorinated gases.[71] CO2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity.[4] Additional CO2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the CO2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser.[72] Methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction.[73] Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser.[74]\\nDespite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth\\'s land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for CO2. Land-surface sink processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, remove about 29% of annual global CO2 emissions.[75] The ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process. First, CO2 dissolves in the surface water. Afterwards, the ocean\\'s overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean\\'s interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle. Over the last two decades, the world\\'s oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted CO2.[76]\\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also affects the climate on a large scale.[77] From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth\\'s surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming,[78] typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning.[79] Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.[80]\\nAerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation. They also have indirect effects on the Earth\\'s radiation budget. Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets.[81] They also reduce the growth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight.[82] Indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.[83]\\nWhile aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming. Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise.[84] Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2\\xa0°C by 2050.[85]\\nHumans change the Earth\\'s surface mainly to create more agricultural land. Today, agriculture takes up 34% of Earth\\'s land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.).[87] The amount of forested land continues to decrease, which is the main land use change that causes global warming.[88] Deforestation releases CO2 contained in trees when they are destroyed, plus it prevents those trees from absorbing more CO2 in the future.[18] The main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil (27%), logging to produce forestry/forest products (26%), short term shifting cultivation (24%), and wildfires (23%).[89]\\nLand use changes not only affect greenhouse gas emissions. The type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature. It impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns.[90] In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to a cooling effect.[90] Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.[91]\\nPhysical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity.[92] As the Sun is the Earth\\'s primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system.[83] Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites,[93] and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards.[83] There has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun\\'s energy reaching the Earth.[94] Further evidence for greenhouse gases causing global warming comes from measurements that show a warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), coupled with a cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere).[95] If solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, the troposphere and stratosphere would both warm.[56]\\nExplosive volcanic eruptions represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era. When the eruption is sufficiently strong (with sulfur dioxide reaching the stratosphere), sunlight can be partially blocked for a couple of years. The temperature signal lasts about twice as long. In the industrial era, volcanic activity has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends.[96] Present-day volcanic CO2 emissions are equivalent to less than 1% of current anthropogenic CO2 emissions.[97]\\nThe response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks: increased by \"self-reinforcing\" or \"positive\" feedbacks and reduced by \"balancing\" or \"negative\" feedbacks.[99] The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds.[100][101] The primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as Earth\\'s surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature.[102] In addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of CO2 on plant growth.[103] Uncertainty over feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions.[104]\\nAs the air is warmed by greenhouse gases, it can hold more moisture. Water vapour is a potent greenhouse gas, so this further heats the atmosphere.[100] If cloud cover increases, more sunlight will be reflected back into space, cooling the planet. If clouds become higher and thinner, they act as an insulator, reflecting heat from below back downwards and warming the planet.[105] The effect of clouds is the largest source of feedback uncertainty.[106]\\nAnother major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the Arctic, which reduces the reflectivity of the Earth\\'s surface.[107]\\nMore of the Sun\\'s energy is now absorbed in these regions, contributing to amplification of Arctic temperature changes.[108] Arctic amplification is also melting permafrost, which releases methane and CO2 into the atmosphere.[109] Climate change can also cause methane releases from wetlands, marine systems, and freshwater systems.[110] Overall, climate feedbacks are expected to become increasingly positive.[111]\\nAround half of human-caused CO2 emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans.[112] On land, elevated CO2 and an extended growing season have stimulated plant growth. Climate change increases droughts and heat waves that inhibit plant growth, which makes it uncertain whether this carbon sink will continue to grow in the future.[113] Soils contain large quantities of carbon and may release some when they heat up.[114] As more CO2 and heat are absorbed by the ocean, it acidifies, its circulation changes and phytoplankton takes up less carbon, decreasing the rate at which the ocean absorbs atmospheric carbon.[115] Overall, at higher CO2 concentrations the Earth will absorb a reduced fraction of our emissions.[116]\\nA climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect the climate system.[117] Models are used to calculate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks.[118][119] Models also include natural processes like changes in the Earth\\'s orbit, historical changes in the Sun\\'s activity, and volcanic forcing.[120] In addition to estimating future temperatures, they reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere.[121]\\nThe physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates.[122] Past models have underestimated the rate of Arctic shrinkage[123] and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase.[124] Sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models, but more recent models agree well with observations.[125] The 2017 United States-published National Climate Assessment notes that \"climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes\".[126]\\nA subset of climate models add societal factors to a simple physical climate model. These models simulate how population, economic growth, and energy use affect\\xa0– and interact with\\xa0– the physical climate. With this information, these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions. This is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future.[127][128] Depending on the socioeconomic scenario and the mitigation scenario, models produce atmospheric CO2 concentrations that range widely between 380 and 1400 ppm.[129]\\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report projects that global warming is very likely to reach 1.0\\xa0°C to 1.8\\xa0°C by the late 21st century under the very low GHG emissions scenario. In an intermediate scenario global warming would reach 2.1\\xa0°C to 3.5\\xa0°C, and 3.3\\xa0°C to 5.7\\xa0°C under the very high GHG emissions scenario.[130] These projections are based on climate models in combination with observations.[131]\\nThe remaining carbon budget is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases.[132] According to the IPCC, global warming can be kept below 1.5\\xa0°C with a two-thirds chance if emissions after 2018 do not exceed 420 or 570 gigatonnes of CO2. This corresponds to 10 to 13 years of current emissions. There are high uncertainties about the budget. For instance, it may be 100 gigatonnes of CO2 smaller due to methane release from permafrost and wetlands.[133] However, it is clear that fossil fuel resources are too abundant for shortages to be relied on to limit carbon emissions in the 21st century.[134]\\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly. Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations.[135] Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency.[136] Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia.[137] The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing,[138] and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming.[139] Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change.[140]\\nGlobal sea level is rising as a consequence of glacial melt, melt of the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and thermal expansion. Between 1993 and 2020, the rise increased over time, averaging 3.3\\xa0±\\xa00.3\\xa0mm per year.[142] Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by 61–110\\xa0cm.[143] Increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug Antarctic glacier outlets, risking a large melt of the ice sheet[144] and the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions.[145]\\nClimate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice.[146] While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5\\xa0°C degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2\\xa0°C.[147] Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to changes in ocean chemistry. An increase in dissolved CO2 is causing oceans to acidify.[148] In addition, oxygen levels are decreasing as oxygen is less soluble in warmer water.[149] Dead zones in the ocean, regions with very little oxygen, are expanding too.[150]\\nGreater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through ‘tipping points’—thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures are reduced.[151][152] An example is the collapse of West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, where a temperature rise of 1.5 to 2\\xa0°C may commit the ice sheets to melt, although the time scale of melt is uncertain and depends on future warming.[153][154] Some large-scale changes could occur over a short time period, such as a shutdown of certain ocean currents like the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).[155] Tipping points can also include irreversible damage to ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs.[156]\\nThe long-term effects of climate change on oceans include further ice melt, ocean warming, sea level rise, and ocean acidification.[157] On the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of climate change will be determined primarily by anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This is due to CO2\\'s long atmospheric lifetime.[158] Oceanic CO2 uptake is slow enough that ocean acidification will continue for hundreds to thousands of years.[159] These emissions are estimated to have prolonged the current interglacial period by at least 100,000 years.[160] Sea level rise will continue over many centuries, with an estimated rise of 2.3 metres per degree Celsius (4.2\\xa0ft/°F) after 2000 years.[161]\\nRecent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes.[162] Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening. However, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions. The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear.[163] Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics.[164] The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely.[165] Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species.[166]\\nThe oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land.[167] Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, harming a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds.[168] Ocean acidification makes it harder for marine calcifying organisms such as mussels, barnacles and corals to produce shells and skeletons; and heatwaves have bleached coral reefs.[169] Harmful algal blooms enhanced by climate change and eutrophication lower oxygen levels, disrupt food webs and cause great loss of marine life.[170] Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress. Almost half of global wetlands have disappeared due to climate change and other human impacts.[171]\\nEcological collapse. Coral bleaching from thermal stress has damaged the Great Barrier Reef and threatens coral reefs worldwide.[172]\\nExtreme weather. Drought and high temperatures worsened the 2020 bushfires in Australia.[173]\\nArctic warming. Permafrost thaws undermine infrastructure and release methane, a greenhouse gas.[109]\\nHabitat destruction. Many arctic animals rely on sea ice, which has been disappearing in a warming Arctic.[174]\\nPest propagation. Mild winters allow more pine beetles to survive to kill large swaths of forest.[175]\\nThe effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world. Impacts can now be observed on all continents and ocean regions,[177] with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk.[178] Continued warming has potentially “severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts” for people and ecosystems.[179] The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries.[180]\\nThe World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30\\u2009years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures.[181]\\nThe WHO has classified climate change as the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[182] Extreme weather leads to injury and loss of life,[183] and crop failures to undernutrition.[184] Various infectious diseases are more easily transmitted in a warmer climate, such as dengue fever and malaria.[185] Young children are the most vulnerable to food shortages. Both children and older people are vulnerable to extreme heat.[186] The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that between 2030 and 2050, climate change would cause around 250,000 additional deaths per year. They assessed deaths from heat exposure in elderly people, increases in diarrhea, malaria, dengue, coastal flooding, and childhood undernutrition.[187] Over 500,000 more adult deaths are projected yearly by 2050 due to reductions in food availability and quality.[188] By 2100, 50% to 75% of the global population may face climate conditions that are life-threatening due to combined effects of extreme heat and humidity.[189]\\nClimate change is affecting food security. It has caused reduction in global yields of maize, wheat, and soybeans between 1981 and 2010.[190] Future warming could further reduce global yields of major crops.[191] Crop production will probably be negatively affected in low-latitude countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative.[192] Up to an additional 183 million people worldwide, particularly those with lower incomes, are at risk of hunger as a consequence of these impacts.[193] Climate change also impacts fish populations. Globally, less will be available to be fished.[194] Regions dependent on glacier water, regions that are already dry, and small islands have a higher risk of water stress due to climate change.[195]\\nEconomic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences.[196] Climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality, and this trend is projected to continue.[197] Most of the severe impacts are expected in sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources[198], and South-East Asia.[199] The World Bank estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030.[200]\\nCurrent inequalities based on wealth and social status have worsened due to climate change.[201] Major difficulties in mitigating, adapting, and recovering to climate shocks are faced by marginalized people who have less control over resources.[202][198] Indigenous people, who are subsistent on their land and ecosystems, will face endangerment to their wellness and lifestyles due to climate change.[203] An expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in armed conflict has been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities.[204]\\nLow-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes flooding more common. Sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea.[205] This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu.[206] In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to.[207] With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in extremely hot and uninhabitable climates, similar to the current climate found in the Sahara.[208] These factors can drive environmental migration, both within and between countries.[10] More people are expected to be displaced because of sea level rise, extreme weather and conflict from increased competition over natural resources. Climate change may also increase vulnerability, leading to \"trapped populations\" who are not able to move due to a lack of resources.[209]\\nEnvironmental migration. Sparser rainfall leads to desertification that harms agriculture and can displace populations. Shown: Telly, Mali (2008).[210]\\nAgricultural changes. Droughts, rising temperatures, and extreme weather negatively impact agriculture. Shown: Texas, US (2013).[211]\\nTidal flooding. Sea-level rise increases flooding in low-lying coastal regions. Shown: Venice, Italy (2004).[212]\\nStorm intensification. Bangladesh after Cyclone Sidr (2007) is an example of catastrophic flooding from increased rainfall.[213]\\nHeat wave intensification. Events like the June 2019 European heat wave are becoming more common.[214]\\nClimate change can be mitigated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and by enhancing sinks that absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.[215] In order to limit global warming to less than 1.5\\xa0°C with a high likelihood of success, global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2\\xa0°C target.[133] This requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry.[216] The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that countries need to triple their pledges under the Paris Agreement within the next decade to limit global warming to 2\\xa0°C. An even greater level of reduction is required to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C goal.[217] With pledges made under the Agreement as of October 2021, global warming would still have a 66% chance of reaching about 2.7\\xa0°C (range: 2.2–3.2\\xa0°C) by the end of the century.[13]\\nAlthough there is no single pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2\\xa0°C,[218] most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions.[219] To reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities, changes would also be necessary in agriculture and forestry,[220] such as preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation.[221]\\nOther approaches to mitigating climate change have a higher level of risk. Scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5\\xa0°C typically project the large-scale use of carbon dioxide removal methods over the 21st century.[222] There are concerns, though, about over-reliance on these technologies, and environmental impacts.[223] Solar radiation management (SRM) is also a possible supplement to deep reductions in emissions. However, SRM would raise significant ethical and legal issues, and the risks are poorly understood.[224]\\nRenewable energy is key to limiting climate change.[226] Fossil fuels accounted for 80% of the world\\'s energy in 2018. The remaining share was split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind and solar power and geothermal energy).[227] That mix is projected to change significantly over the next 30 years.[219] Solar panels and onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in many locations.[228] Renewables represented 75% of all new electricity generation installed in 2019, nearly all solar and wind.[229] Other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply. However, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison.[230]\\nTo achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios. Investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050.[231][232]\\nElectricity would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport.[233]\\nIn transport, emissions can be reduced fast by a switch to electric vehicles.[234] Public transport and active transport (cycling and walking) also produce less CO2.[235] For shipping and flying, low-carbon fuels can be used to reduce emissions.[234] Heating would be increasingly decarbonised with technologies like heat pumps.[236]\\nThere are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy, including renewables. For wind and solar, there are environmental and land use concerns for new projects.[237] Wind and solar also produce energy intermittently and with seasonal variability. Traditionally, hydro dams with reservoirs and conventional power plants have been used when variable energy production is low. Going forward, battery storage can be expanded, energy demand and supply can be matched, and long-distance transmission can smooth variability of renewable outputs.[226] Bioenergy is often not carbon-neutral and may have negative consequences for food security.[238] The growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around nuclear waste, nuclear weapon proliferation, and accidents.[239][240] Hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed, and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns.[241]\\nLow-carbon energy improves human health by minimising climate change. It also has the near-term benefit of reducing air pollution deaths,[242] which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016.[243] Meeting the Paris Agreement goals that limit warming to a 2\\xa0°C increase could save about a million of those lives per year by 2050, whereas limiting global warming to 1.5\\xa0°C could save millions and simultaneously increase energy security and reduce poverty.[244]\\nReducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions.[245] If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development. It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimises carbon-intensive infrastructure development.[246] Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy.[247] Several COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain.[248]\\nStrategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector. In transport, passengers and freight can switch to more efficient travel modes, such as buses and trains, or use electric vehicles.[249] Industrial strategies to reduce energy demand include improving heating systems and motors, designing less energy-intensive products, and increasing product lifetimes.[250] In the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings, and higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting.[251] The use of technologies like heat pumps can also increase building energy efficiency.[252]\\n Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand.[253] A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two thirds from 2010 levels. These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production.[254]\\nOn the demand side, a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towards plant-based diets.[255] Eliminating the production of livestock for meat and dairy would eliminate about 3/4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use.[256] Livestock also occupy 37% of ice-free land area on Earth and consume feed from the 12% of land area used for crops, driving deforestation and land degradation.[257]\\nSteel and cement production are responsible for about 13% of industrial CO2 emissions. In these industries, carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production, so that reducing CO2 emissions requires research into alternative chemistries.[258]\\nNatural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels.[259] Reforestation and tree planting on non-forest lands are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns.[260] Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments.[261] Restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter (blue carbon).[262] When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems.[263]\\nWhere energy production or CO2-intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste CO2, the gas can be captured and stored instead of released to the atmosphere. Although its current use is limited in scale and expensive,[264] carbon capture and storage (CCS) may be able to play a significant role in limiting CO2 emissions by mid-century.[265] This technique, in combination with bio-energy (BECCS) can result in net negative emissions: CO2 is drawn from the atmosphere.[266] It remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques, such as BECCS, will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 1.5\\xa0°C. Policy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals.[267]\\nAdaptation is \"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects\".[268] Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of \"severe, widespread and irreversible\" impacts.[269] More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive.[268] The capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less.[270] The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow. Many countries have implemented adaptation policies. However, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance.[271]\\nAdaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at-risk areas, learning to live with increased flooding and protection. If that fails, managed retreat may be needed.[272] There are economic barriers for tackling dangerous heat impact. Avoiding strenuous work or having air conditioning is not possible for everybody.[273] In agriculture, adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets, diversification, erosion control and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate.[274] Insurance allows for risk-sharing, but is often difficult to get for people on lower incomes.[275] Education, migration and early warning systems can reduce climate vulnerability.[276]\\nEcosystems adapt to climate change, a process that can be supported by human intervention. By increasing connectivity between ecosystems, species can migrate to more favourable climate conditions. Species can also be introduced to areas acquiring a favorable climate. Protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas helps build resilience, making it easier for ecosystems to adapt. Many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems, also help humans adapt via ecosystem-based adaptation. For instance, restoration of natural fire regimes makes catastrophic fires less likely, and reduces human exposure. Giving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system, reducing flood risk. Restored forest acts as a carbon sink, but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts.[277]\\nThere are synergies and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation. Adaptation often offer short-term benefits, whereas mitigation has longer-term benefits.[278] Increased use of air conditioning allows people to better cope with heat, but increases energy demand. Compact urban development may lead to reduced emissions from transport and construction. At the same time, it may increase the urban heat island effect, leading to higher temperatures and increased exposure.[279] Increased food productivity has large benefits for both adaptation and mitigation.[280]\\nCountries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions. This raises questions about justice and fairness.[281] Climate change is strongly linked to sustainable development. Limiting global warming makes it easier to achieve sustainable development goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities. The connection is recognised in Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to \"take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\".[282] The goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation.[283]\\nThe geopolitics of climate change is complex. It has often been framed as a free-rider problem, in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from switching to a low-carbon economy themselves. This framing has been challenged. For instance, the benefits of a coal phase-out to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions.[284] Furthermore, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy, causing net exporters to face stranded assets: fossil fuels they cannot sell.[285]\\nA wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions. As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.[286] Carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems.[287] Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in.[288] Ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths.[289] Money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead.[290] More direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry.[291] Several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production.[292]\\nPolicy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality. For instance, wealthy nations responsible for the largest share of emissions would have to pay poorer countries to adapt.[293] As the use of fossil fuels is reduced, jobs in the sector are being lost. To achieve a just transition, these people would need to be retrained for other jobs. Communities with many fossil fuel workers would need additional investments.[294]\\nNearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).[296] The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.[297] As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained.[298] The UNFCCC does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do. Global emissions have risen since the UNFCCC was signed.[299] Its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations.[300]\\nThe 1997 Kyoto Protocol extended the UNFCCC and included legally binding commitments for most developed countries to limit their emissions.[301] During the negotiations, the G77 (representing developing countries) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to \"[take] the lead\" in reducing their emissions,[302] since developed countries contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Per-capita emissions were also still relatively low in developing countries and developing countries would need to emit more to meet their development needs.[303]\\nThe 2009 Copenhagen Accord has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals, and was rejected by poorer nations including the G77.[304] Associated parties aimed to limit the global temperature rise to below 2\\xa0°C.[305] The Accord set the goal of sending $100 billion per year to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and proposed the founding of the Green Climate Fund.[306] As of 2020[update], the fund has failed to reach its expected target, and risks a shrinkage in its funding.[307]\\nIn 2015 all UN countries negotiated the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming well below 2.0\\xa0°C and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under 1.5\\xa0°C.[308] The agreement replaced the Kyoto Protocol. Unlike Kyoto, no binding emission targets were set in the Paris Agreement. Instead, a set of procedures was made binding. Countries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years.[309] The Paris Agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported.[310] As of October 2021[update], 194 states and the European Union have signed the treaty and 191 states and the EU have ratified or acceded to the agreement.[311]\\nThe 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to stop emitting ozone-depleting gases, may have been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the Kyoto Protocol specifically designed to do so.[312] The 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol aims to reduce the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a group of powerful greenhouse gases which served as a replacement for banned ozone-depleting gases. This made the Montreal Protocol a stronger agreement against climate change.[313]\\nIn 2019, the United Kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency.[314] Other countries and jurisdictions followed suit.[315] That same year, the European Parliament declared a \"climate and environmental emergency\".[316] The European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050.[317] Major countries in Asia have made similar pledges: South Korea and Japan have committed to become carbon-neutral by 2050, and China by 2060.[318] In 2021, the European Commission released its “Fit for 55” legislation package, which contains guidelines for the car industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035.[319] While India has strong incentives for renewables, it also plans a significant expansion of coal in the country.[320]\\nAs of 2021, based on information from 48 national climate plans, which represent 40% of the parties to the Paris Agreement, estimated total greenhouse gas emissions will be 0.5% lower compared to 2010 levels, below the 45% or 25% reduction goals to limit global warming to 1.5\\xa0°C or 2\\xa0°C, respectively.[321]\\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia. The actors behind climate change denial form a well-funded and relatively coordinated coalition of fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists.[323] Like the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about scientific data and results.[324] Many who deny, dismiss, or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change are labelled as \"climate change skeptics\", which several scientists have noted is a misnomer.[325]\\nThere are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimise the negative impacts of climate change.[326] Manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a manufactured controversy: creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes.[327] Strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions,[328] and questioning the motives of individual scientists.[326] An echo chamber of climate-denying blogs and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change.[329]\\nClimate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s.[333] Due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion.[334] In popular culture, the climate fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006) focused on climate change.[333]\\nSignificant regional, gender, age and political differences exist in both public concern for, and understanding of, climate change. More highly educated people, and in some countries, women and younger people, were more likely to see climate change as a serious threat.[335] Partisan gaps also exist in many countries,[336] and countries with high CO2 emissions tend to be less concerned.[337] Views on causes of climate change vary widely between countries.[338] Concern has increased over time,[336] to the point where in 2021 a majority of citizens in many countries express a high level of worry about climate change, or view it as a global emergency.[339] Higher levels of worry are associated with stronger public support for policies that address climate change.[340]\\nClimate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change. They can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities.[341] Prominent demonstrations include the School Strike for Climate. In this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg.[342] Mass civil disobedience actions by groups like Extinction Rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport.[343] Litigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action from public institutions and companies. Activists also initiate lawsuits which target governments and demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws on climate change.[344] Lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies generally seek compensation for loss and damage.[345]\\nIn the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth\\'s temperature was higher than the sun\\'s energy alone could explain. Earth\\'s atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat. However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat, which in turn warms the planet.[347]\\nIn 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and that the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide (CO2). She concluded that \"An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature...\"[348][349]\\nStarting in 1859,[350] John Tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygen—together totaling 99% of dry air—are transparent to radiated heat. However, water vapour and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide absorb radiated heat and re-radiate that heat into the atmosphere. Tyndall proposed that changes in the concentrations of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past, including ice ages.[351]\\nSvante Arrhenius noted that water vapour in air continuously varied, but the CO2 concentration in air was influenced by long-term geological processes. Warming from increased CO2 levels would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying warming in a positive feedback loop. In 1896, he published the first climate model of its kind, projecting that halving CO2 levels could have produced a drop in temperature initiating an ice age. Arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling CO2 to be around 5–6\\xa0°C.[352] Other scientists were initially skeptical and believed that the greenhouse effect was saturated so that adding more CO2 would make no difference, and that the climate would be self-regulating.[353] Beginning in 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar published evidence that climate was warming and CO2 levels were rising,[354] but his calculations met the same objections.[353]\\nIn the 1950s, Gilbert Plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum. This model predicted that increasing CO2 levels would cause warming. Around the same time, Hans Suess found evidence that CO2 levels had been rising, and Roger Revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase. The two scientists subsequently helped Charles Keeling to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the \"Keeling Curve\".[353] Scientists alerted the public,[355] and the dangers were highlighted at James Hansen\\'s 1988 Congressional testimony.[22] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world\\'s governments, spurred interdisciplinary research.[356] As part of the IPCC reports, scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer-reviewed journal articles.[357]\\nThere is a near-complete scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities. As of 2019, agreement in recent literature reached over 99%.[358][359] No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.[360] Consensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change. National science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions.[361] The 2021 IPCC Assessment Report stated that it is \"unequivocal\" that climate change is caused by humans.[359]\\nFourth Assessment Report\\nFifth Assessment report\\n\\nSpecial Report: Global Warming of 1.5\\xa0°C\\nSpecial Report: Climate change and Land\\nSpecial Report: The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate\\nSixth Assessment Report\\n']"

sense also includes previous long term changes to earth s climate  the current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes  and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels    fossil fuel use  deforestation  and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases  notably carbon dioxide and methane   greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the earth radiates after it warms from sunlight  larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in earth s lower atmosphere  causing global warming  due to climate change  deserts are expanding  while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common   increased warming in the arctic has contributed to melting permafrost  glacial retreat and sea ice loss   higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms  droughts  and other weather extremes   rapid environmental change in mountains  coral reefs  and the arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct   even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful  some effects will continue for centuries  these include ocean heating  ocean acidification and sea level rise   climate change threatens people with food and water scarcity  increased flooding  extreme heat  more disease  and economic loss  human migration and conflict can also be a result   the world health organization  who  calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century   communities may adapt to climate change through efforts like coastline protection or expanding access to air conditioning  but some impacts are unavoidable  poorer countries are responsible for a small share of global emissions  yet they have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change  many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1 2  c  2 2  f  level of warming  additional warming will increase these impacts and may trigger tipping points  such as the melting of the greenland ice sheet   under the 2015 paris agreement  nations collectively agreed to keep warming  well under 2  c   however  with pledges made under the agreement  global warming would still reach about 2 7  c  4 9  f  by the end of the century   limiting warming to 1 5  c will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050   reducing emissions requires generating electricity from low carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels  this change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants  vastly increasing use of wind  solar  and other types of renewable energy  and reducing energy use  electricity generated from non carbon emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation  heating buildings  and operating industrial facilities    carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere  for instance by increasing forest cover and by farming with methods that capture carbon in soil   before the 1980s  when it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases were stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution  scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate   in the 1980s  the terms global warming and climate change became more common  though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably   scientifically  global warming refers only to increased surface warming  and climate change describes the full effect of greenhouse gases on earth s climate system   global warming used as early as   became the more popular term after nasa climate scientist james hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the u s  senate   since the 2000s  climate change has increased in usage   climate change can also refer more broadly to both human caused changes or natural changes throughout earth s history   various scientists  politicians and media now use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change  and global heating instead of global warming   multiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming   the 2011 2020 decade warmed to an average 1 09  c  0 95 1 20  c  compared to the pre industrial baseline  1850 1900    surface temperatures are rising by about 0 2  c per decade   with 2020 reaching a temperature of 1 2  c above the pre industrial era   since 1950  the number of cold days and nights has decreased  and the number of warm days and nights has increased   there was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid 19th century  climate information for that period comes from climate proxies  such as trees and ice cores   thermometer records began to provide global coverage around 1850   historical patterns of warming and cooling  like the medieval climate anomaly and the little ice age  did not occur at the same time across different regions  temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late 20th century in a limited set of regions   there have been prehistorical episodes of global warming  such as the paleocene eocene thermal maximum   however  the modern observed rise in temperature and co2 concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events in earth s history do not approach current rates   evidence of warming from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other observations    for example  changes to the natural water cycle have been predicted and observed  such as an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation  melting of snow and land ice  and increased atmospheric humidity   flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming  for instance  plants are flowering earlier in spring   another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere  which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the earth s surface and preventing it from radiating into space   regions of the world warm at differing rates  the pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted  because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet  since the pre industrial period  the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature   this is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans  and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation   the thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970  and over 90  of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean    the rest has heated the atmosphere  melted ice  and warmed the continents   the northern hemisphere and the north pole have warmed much faster than the south pole and southern hemisphere  the northern hemisphere not only has much more land  but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice  as these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted  they start absorbing more heat   local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to arctic warming   arctic temperatures are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world   melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the arctic disrupts ocean circulation  including a weakened gulf stream  further changing the climate   the climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years  such as the el niño southern oscillation  enso    decades or even centuries   other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is  external  to the climate system  but not always external to the earth   examples of external forcings include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases  solar luminosity  volcanic eruptions  and variations in the earth s orbit around the sun   to determine the human contribution to climate change  known internal climate variability and natural external forcings need to be ruled out  a key approach is to determine unique  fingerprints  for all potential causes  then compare these fingerprints with observed patterns of climate change   for example  solar forcing can be ruled out as a major cause  its fingerprint would be warming in the entire atmosphere  yet  only the lower atmosphere has warmed  consistent with greenhouse gas forcing   attribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases  with aerosols having a dampening effect   greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight  and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the earth s surface  the earth radiates it as heat  and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it  this absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space  trapping heat near the earth s surface and warming it over time   before the industrial revolution  naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33  c warmer than it would have been in their absence    while water vapour   50   and clouds   25   are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect  they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks  on the other hand  concentrations of gases such as co2   20    tropospheric ozone   cfcs and nitrous oxide are not temperature dependent  and are therefore external forcings   human activity since the industrial revolution  mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels  coal  oil  and natural gas    has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  resulting in a radiative imbalance  in 2019  the concentrations of co2 and methane had increased by about 48  and 160   respectively  since 1750   these co2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 2 million years  concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800 000 years   global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of co2  of these emissions  75  was co2  18  was methane  4  was nitrous oxide  and 2  was fluorinated gases   co2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport  manufacturing  heating  and electricity   additional co2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes  which include the co2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement  steel  aluminum  and fertiliser   methane emissions come from livestock  manure  rice cultivation  landfills  wastewater  and coal mining  as well as oil and gas extraction   nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser   despite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions  the earth s land surface  particularly its forests  remain a significant carbon sink for co2  land surface sink processes  such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis  remove about 29  of annual global co2 emissions   the ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two step process  first  co2 dissolves in the surface water  afterwards  the ocean s overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean s interior  where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle  over the last two decades  the world s oceans have absorbed 20 to 30  of emitted co2   air pollution  in the form of aerosols  not only puts a large burden on human health  but also affects the climate on a large scale   from 1961 to 1990  a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the earth s surface was observed  a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming   typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning   globally  aerosols have been declining since 1990  meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much   aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation  they also have indirect effects on the earth s radiation budget  sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets  these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets   they also reduce the growth of raindrops  which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight   indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing   while aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight  black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming  not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight  it also increases melting and sea level rise   limiting new black carbon deposits in the arctic could reduce global warming by 0 2  c by 2050   humans change the earth s surface mainly to create more agricultural land  today  agriculture takes up 34  of earth s land area  while 26  is forests  and 30  is uninhabitable  glaciers  deserts  etc     the amount of forested land continues to decrease  which is the main land use change that causes global warming   deforestation releases co2 contained in trees when they are destroyed  plus it prevents those trees from absorbing more co2 in the future   the main causes of deforestation are  permanent land use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil  27    logging to produce forestry forest products  26    short term shifting cultivation  24    and wildfires  23     land use changes not only affect greenhouse gas emissions  the type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature  it impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space  albedo   and how much heat is lost by evaporation  for instance  the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter  causing it to reflect more sunlight  deforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds  and by changing wind patterns   in tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming  while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo  as forest is replaced by snow cover  leads to a cooling effect   globally  these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling  dominated by an increase in surface albedo   physical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity   as the sun is the earth s primary energy source  changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system   solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites   and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards   there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun s energy reaching the earth   further evidence for greenhouse gases causing global warming comes from measurements that show a warming of the lower atmosphere  the troposphere   coupled with a cooling of the upper atmosphere  the stratosphere    if solar variations were responsible for the observed warming  the troposphere and stratosphere would both warm   explosive volcanic eruptions represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era  when the eruption is sufficiently strong  with sulfur dioxide reaching the stratosphere   sunlight can be partially blocked for a couple of years  the temperature signal lasts about twice as long  in the industrial era  volcanic activity has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends   present day volcanic co2 emissions are equivalent to less than 1  of current anthropogenic co2 emissions   the response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks  increased by  self reinforcing  or  positive  feedbacks and reduced by  balancing  or  negative  feedbacks   the main reinforcing feedbacks are the water vapour feedback  the ice albedo feedback  and the net effect of clouds    the primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling  as earth s surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature   in addition to temperature feedbacks  there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle  such as the fertilizing effect of co2 on plant growth   uncertainty over feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions   as the air is warmed by greenhouse gases  it can hold more moisture  water vapour is a potent greenhouse gas  so this further heats the atmosphere   if cloud cover increases  more sunlight will be reflected back into space  cooling the planet  if clouds become higher and thinner  they act as an insulator  reflecting heat from below back downwards and warming the planet   the effect of clouds is the largest source of feedback uncertainty   another major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the arctic  which reduces the reflectivity of the earth s surface   more of the sun s energy is now absorbed in these regions  contributing to amplification of arctic temperature changes   arctic amplification is also melting permafrost  which releases methane and co2 into the atmosphere   climate change can also cause methane releases from wetlands  marine systems  and freshwater systems   overall  climate feedbacks are expected to become increasingly positive   around half of human caused co2 emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans   on land  elevated co2 and an extended growing season have stimulated plant growth  climate change increases droughts and heat waves that inhibit plant growth  which makes it uncertain whether this carbon sink will continue to grow in the future   soils contain large quantities of carbon and may release some when they heat up   as more co2 and heat are absorbed by the ocean  it acidifies  its circulation changes and phytoplankton takes up less carbon  decreasing the rate at which the ocean absorbs atmospheric carbon   overall  at higher co2 concentrations the earth will absorb a reduced fraction of our emissions   a climate model is a representation of the physical  chemical  and biological processes that affect the climate system   models are used to calculate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks    models also include natural processes like changes in the earth s orbit  historical changes in the sun s activity  and volcanic forcing   in addition to estimating future temperatures  they reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans  the annual cycle of the seasons  and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere   the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates   past models have underestimated the rate of arctic shrinkage  and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase   sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models  but more recent models agree well with observations   the 2017 united states published national climate assessment notes that  climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes    a subset of climate models add societal factors to a simple physical climate model  these models simulate how population  economic growth  and energy use affect   and interact with   the physical climate  with this information  these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions  this is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future    depending on the socioeconomic scenario and the mitigation scenario  models produce atmospheric co2 concentrations that range widely between 380 and 1400 ppm   the ipcc sixth assessment report projects that global warming is very likely to reach 1 0  c to 1 8  c by the late 21st century under the very low ghg emissions scenario  in an intermediate scenario global warming would reach 2 1  c to 3 5  c  and 3 3  c to 5 7  c under the very high ghg emissions scenario   these projections are based on climate models in combination with observations   the remaining carbon budget is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases   according to the ipcc  global warming can be kept below 1 5  c with a two thirds chance if emissions after 2018 do not exceed 420 or 570 gigatonnes of co2  this corresponds to 10 to 13 years of current emissions  there are high uncertainties about the budget  for instance  it may be 100 gigatonnes of co2 smaller due to methane release from permafrost and wetlands   however  it is clear that fossil fuel resources are too abundant for shortages to be relied on to limit carbon emissions in the 21st century   the environmental effects of climate change are broad and far reaching  affecting oceans  ice  and weather  changes may occur gradually or rapidly  evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past  from modelling  and from modern observations   since the 1950s  droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency   extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in india and east asia   the rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing   and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming   frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change   global sea level is rising as a consequence of glacial melt  melt of the ice sheets in greenland and antarctica  and thermal expansion  between 1993 and 2020  the rise increased over time  averaging 3 3   0 3 mm per year   over the 21st century  the ipcc projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by 61 110 cm   increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug antarctic glacier outlets  risking a large melt of the ice sheet  and the possibility of a 2 meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions   climate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the arctic sea ice   while ice free summers are expected to be rare at 1 5  c degrees of warming  they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2  c   higher atmospheric co2 concentrations have led to changes in ocean chemistry  an increase in dissolved co2 is causing oceans to acidify   in addition  oxygen levels are decreasing as oxygen is less soluble in warmer water   dead zones in the ocean  regions with very little oxygen  are expanding too   greater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through  tipping points  thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures are reduced    an example is the collapse of west antarctic and greenland ice sheets  where a temperature rise of 1 5 to 2  c may commit the ice sheets to melt  although the time scale of melt is uncertain and depends on future warming    some large scale changes could occur over a short time period  such as a shutdown of certain ocean currents like the atlantic meridional overturning circulation  amoc    tipping points can also include irreversible damage to ecosystems like the amazon rainforest and coral reefs   the long term effects of climate change on oceans include further ice melt  ocean warming  sea level rise  and ocean acidification   on the timescale of centuries to millennia  the magnitude of climate change will be determined primarily by anthropogenic co2 emissions  this is due to co2 s long atmospheric lifetime   oceanic co2 uptake is slow enough that ocean acidification will continue for hundreds to thousands of years   these emissions are estimated to have prolonged the current interglacial period by at least 100 000 years   sea level rise will continue over many centuries  with an estimated rise of 2 3 metres per degree celsius  4 2 ft  f  after 2000 years   recent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes   higher atmospheric co2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening  however  heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions  the future balance of these opposing effects is unclear   climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones  such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics   the size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely   overall  it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species   the oceans have heated more slowly than the land  but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land   just as on land  heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change  harming a wide range of organisms such as corals  kelp  and seabirds   ocean acidification makes it harder for marine calcifying organisms such as mussels  barnacles and corals to produce shells and skeletons  and heatwaves have bleached coral reefs   harmful algal blooms enhanced by climate change and eutrophication lower oxygen levels  disrupt food webs and cause great loss of marine life   coastal ecosystems are under particular stress  almost half of global wetlands have disappeared due to climate change and other human impacts   ecological collapse  coral bleaching from thermal stress has damaged the great barrier reef and threatens coral reefs worldwide   extreme weather  drought and high temperatures worsened the 2020 bushfires in australia   arctic warming  permafrost thaws undermine infrastructure and release methane  a greenhouse gas   habitat destruction  many arctic animals rely on sea ice  which has been disappearing in a warming arctic   pest propagation  mild winters allow more pine beetles to survive to kill large swaths of forest   the effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world  impacts can now be observed on all continents and ocean regions   with low latitude  less developed areas facing the greatest risk   continued warming has potentially  severe  pervasive and irreversible impacts  for people and ecosystems   the risks are unevenly distributed  but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries   the world health organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30 years already claim over 150 000 lives annually  many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations  from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves  to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures   the who has classified climate change as the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century   extreme weather leads to injury and loss of life   and crop failures to undernutrition   various infectious diseases are more easily transmitted in a warmer climate  such as dengue fever and malaria   young children are the most vulnerable to food shortages  both children and older people are vulnerable to extreme heat   the world health organization  who  has estimated that between 2030 and 2050  climate change would cause around 250 000 additional deaths per year  they assessed deaths from heat exposure in elderly people  increases in diarrhea  malaria  dengue  coastal flooding  and childhood undernutrition   over 500 000 more adult deaths are projected yearly by 2050 due to reductions in food availability and quality   by 2100  50  to 75  of the global population may face climate conditions that are life threatening due to combined effects of extreme heat and humidity   climate change is affecting food security  it has caused reduction in global yields of maize  wheat  and soybeans between 1981 and 2010   future warming could further reduce global yields of major crops   crop production will probably be negatively affected in low latitude countries  while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative   up to an additional 183 million people worldwide  particularly those with lower incomes  are at risk of hunger as a consequence of these impacts   climate change also impacts fish populations  globally  less will be available to be fished   regions dependent on glacier water  regions that are already dry  and small islands have a higher risk of water stress due to climate change   economic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences   climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality  and this trend is projected to continue   most of the severe impacts are expected in sub saharan africa  where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources   and south east asia   the world bank estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030   current inequalities based on wealth and social status have worsened due to climate change   major difficulties in mitigating  adapting  and recovering to climate shocks are faced by marginalized people who have less control over resources    indigenous people  who are subsistent on their land and ecosystems  will face endangerment to their wellness and lifestyles due to climate change   an expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in armed conflict has been small compared to factors such as socio economic inequality and state capabilities   low lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise  which makes flooding more common  sometimes  land is permanently lost to the sea   this could lead to statelessness for people in island nations  such as the maldives and tuvalu   in some regions  the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to   with worst case climate change  models project that almost one third of humanity might live in extremely hot and uninhabitable climates  similar to the current climate found in the sahara   these factors can drive environmental migration  both within and between countries   more people are expected to be displaced because of sea level rise  extreme weather and conflict from increased competition over natural resources  climate change may also increase vulnerability  leading to  trapped populations  who are not able to move due to a lack of resources   environmental migration  sparser rainfall leads to desertification that harms agriculture and can displace populations  shown  telly  mali  2008    agricultural changes  droughts  rising temperatures  and extreme weather negatively impact agriculture  shown  texas  us  2013    tidal flooding  sea level rise increases flooding in low lying coastal regions  shown  venice  italy  2004    storm intensification  bangladesh after cyclone sidr  2007  is an example of catastrophic flooding from increased rainfall   heat wave intensification  events like the june 2019 european heat wave are becoming more common   climate change can be mitigated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and by enhancing sinks that absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere   in order to limit global warming to less than 1 5  c with a high likelihood of success  global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net zero by 2050  or by 2070 with a 2  c target   this requires far reaching  systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy  land  cities  transport  buildings  and industry   the united nations environment programme estimates that countries need to triple their pledges under the paris agreement within the next decade to limit global warming to 2  c  an even greater level of reduction is required to meet the 1 5  c goal   with pledges made under the agreement as of october 2021  global warming would still have a 66  chance of reaching about 2 7  c  range  2 2 3 2  c  by the end of the century   although there is no single pathway to limit global warming to 1 5 or 2  c   most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions   to reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities  changes would also be necessary in agriculture and forestry   such as preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation   other approaches to mitigating climate change have a higher level of risk  scenarios that limit global warming to 1 5  c typically project the large scale use of carbon dioxide removal methods over the 21st century   there are concerns  though  about over reliance on these technologies  and environmental impacts   solar radiation management  srm  is also a possible supplement to deep reductions in emissions  however  srm would raise significant ethical and legal issues  and the risks are poorly understood   renewable energy is key to limiting climate change   fossil fuels accounted for 80  of the world s energy in 2018  the remaining share was split between nuclear power and renewables  including hydropower  bioenergy  wind and solar power and geothermal energy    that mix is projected to change significantly over the next 30 years   solar panels and onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in many locations   renewables represented 75  of all new electricity generation installed in 2019  nearly all solar and wind   other forms of clean energy  such as nuclear and hydropower  currently have a larger share of the energy supply  however  their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison   to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050  renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation  rising to 85  or more by 2050 in some scenarios  investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050    electricity would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport   in transport  emissions can be reduced fast by a switch to electric vehicles   public transport and active transport  cycling and walking  also produce less co2   for shipping and flying  low carbon fuels can be used to reduce emissions   heating would be increasingly decarbonised with technologies like heat pumps   there are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy  including renewables  for wind and solar  there are environmental and land use concerns for new projects   wind and solar also produce energy intermittently and with seasonal variability  traditionally  hydro dams with reservoirs and conventional power plants have been used when variable energy production is low  going forward  battery storage can be expanded  energy demand and supply can be matched  and long distance transmission can smooth variability of renewable outputs   bioenergy is often not carbon neutral and may have negative consequences for food security   the growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around nuclear waste  nuclear weapon proliferation  and accidents    hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed  and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns   low carbon energy improves human health by minimising climate change  it also has the near term benefit of reducing air pollution deaths   which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016   meeting the paris agreement goals that limit warming to a 2  c increase could save about a million of those lives per year by 2050  whereas limiting global warming to 1 5  c could save millions and simultaneously increase energy security and reduce poverty   reducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions   if less energy is needed  there is more flexibility for clean energy development  it also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid  and minimises carbon intensive infrastructure development   major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals  comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy   several covid 19 related changes in energy use patterns  energy efficiency investments  and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain   strategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector  in transport  passengers and freight can switch to more efficient travel modes  such as buses and trains  or use electric vehicles   industrial strategies to reduce energy demand include improving heating systems and motors  designing less energy intensive products  and increasing product lifetimes   in the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings  and higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting   the use of technologies like heat pumps can also increase building energy efficiency    agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions  preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land  and meeting increases in world food demand   a set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry based emissions by two thirds from 2010 levels  these include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products  increasing land productivity  protecting and restoring forests  and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production   on the demand side  a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towards plant based diets   eliminating the production of livestock for meat and dairy would eliminate about 3 4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use   livestock also occupy 37  of ice free land area on earth and consume feed from the 12  of land area used for crops  driving deforestation and land degradation   steel and cement production are responsible for about 13  of industrial co2 emissions  in these industries  carbon intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production  so that reducing co2 emissions requires research into alternative chemistries   natural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of co2 beyond naturally occurring levels   reforestation and tree planting on non forest lands are among the most mature sequestration techniques  although the latter raises food security concerns   farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops  reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage  and using compost and manure as soil amendments   restoration recreation of coastal wetlands and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter  blue carbon    when carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees  there is a risk of the carbon being re released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use  fire  or other changes in ecosystems   where energy production or co2 intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste co2  the gas can be captured and stored instead of released to the atmosphere  although its current use is limited in scale and expensive   carbon capture and storage  ccs  may be able to play a significant role in limiting co2 emissions by mid century   this technique  in combination with bio energy  beccs  can result in net negative emissions  co2 is drawn from the atmosphere   it remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques  such as beccs  will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 1 5  c  policy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals   adaptation is  the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects    without additional mitigation  adaptation cannot avert the risk of  severe  widespread and irreversible  impacts   more severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation  which can be prohibitively expensive   the capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations  and developing countries generally have less   the first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low  and middle income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity  but progress is slow  many countries have implemented adaptation policies  however  there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance   adaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at risk areas  learning to live with increased flooding and protection  if that fails  managed retreat may be needed   there are economic barriers for tackling dangerous heat impact  avoiding strenuous work or having air conditioning is not possible for everybody   in agriculture  adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets  diversification  erosion control and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate   insurance allows for risk sharing  but is often difficult to get for people on lower incomes   education  migration and early warning systems can reduce climate vulnerability   ecosystems adapt to climate change  a process that can be supported by human intervention  by increasing connectivity between ecosystems  species can migrate to more favourable climate conditions  species can also be introduced to areas acquiring a favorable climate  protection and restoration of natural and semi natural areas helps build resilience  making it easier for ecosystems to adapt  many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems  also help humans adapt via ecosystem based adaptation  for instance  restoration of natural fire regimes makes catastrophic fires less likely  and reduces human exposure  giving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system  reducing flood risk  restored forest acts as a carbon sink  but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts   there are synergies and trade offs between adaptation and mitigation  adaptation often offer short term benefits  whereas mitigation has longer term benefits   increased use of air conditioning allows people to better cope with heat  but increases energy demand  compact urban development may lead to reduced emissions from transport and construction  at the same time  it may increase the urban heat island effect  leading to higher temperatures and increased exposure   increased food productivity has large benefits for both adaptation and mitigation   countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions  this raises questions about justice and fairness   climate change is strongly linked to sustainable development  limiting global warming makes it easier to achieve sustainable development goals  such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities  the connection is recognised in sustainable development goal 13 which is to  take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts    the goals on food  clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation   the geopolitics of climate change is complex  it has often been framed as a free rider problem  in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries  but individual countries would lose from switching to a low carbon economy themselves  this framing has been challenged  for instance  the benefits of a coal phase out to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions   furthermore  net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy  causing net exporters to face stranded assets  fossil fuels they cannot sell   a wide range of policies  regulations  and laws are being used to reduce emissions  as of 2019  carbon pricing covers about 20  of global greenhouse gas emissions   carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems   direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached  319 billion in 2017  and  5 2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in   ending these can cause a 28  reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46  reduction in air pollution deaths   money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead   more direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards  renewable fuel standards  and air pollution regulations on heavy industry   several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production   policy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality  for instance  wealthy nations responsible for the largest share of emissions would have to pay poorer countries to adapt   as the use of fossil fuels is reduced  jobs in the sector are being lost  to achieve a just transition  these people would need to be retrained for other jobs  communities with many fossil fuel workers would need additional investments   nearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc    the goal of the unfccc is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system   as stated in the convention  this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change  food production is not threatened  and economic development can be sustained   the unfccc does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do  global emissions have risen since the unfccc was signed   its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations   the 1997 kyoto protocol extended the unfccc and included legally binding commitments for most developed countries to limit their emissions   during the negotiations  the g77  representing developing countries  pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to   take  the lead  in reducing their emissions   since developed countries contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  per capita emissions were also still relatively low in developing countries and developing countries would need to emit more to meet their development needs   the 2009 copenhagen accord has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals  and was rejected by poorer nations including the g77   associated parties aimed to limit the global temperature rise to below 2  c   the accord set the goal of sending  100 billion per year to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation by 2020  and proposed the founding of the green climate fund   as of 2020 update   the fund has failed to reach its expected target  and risks a shrinkage in its funding   in 2015 all un countries negotiated the paris agreement  which aims to keep global warming well below 2 0  c and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under 1 5  c   the agreement replaced the kyoto protocol  unlike kyoto  no binding emission targets were set in the paris agreement  instead  a set of procedures was made binding  countries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years   the paris agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported   as of october 2021 update   194 states and the european union have signed the treaty and 191 states and the eu have ratified or acceded to the agreement   the 1987 montreal protocol  an international agreement to stop emitting ozone depleting gases  may have been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the kyoto protocol specifically designed to do so   the 2016 kigali amendment to the montreal protocol aims to reduce the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons  a group of powerful greenhouse gases which served as a replacement for banned ozone depleting gases  this made the montreal protocol a stronger agreement against climate change   in 2019  the united kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency   other countries and jurisdictions followed suit   that same year  the european parliament declared a  climate and environmental emergency    the european commission presented its european green deal with the goal of making the eu carbon neutral by 2050   major countries in asia have made similar pledges  south korea and japan have committed to become carbon neutral by 2050  and china by 2060   in 2021  the european commission released its  fit for 55  legislation package  which contains guidelines for the car industry  all new cars on the european market must be zero emission vehicles from 2035   while india has strong incentives for renewables  it also plans a significant expansion of coal in the country   as of 2021  based on information from 48 national climate plans  which represent 40  of the parties to the paris agreement  estimated total greenhouse gas emissions will be 0 5  lower compared to 2010 levels  below the 45  or 25  reduction goals to limit global warming to 1 5  c or 2  c  respectively   public debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation  which originated in the united states and has since spread to other countries  particularly canada and australia  the actors behind climate change denial form a well funded and relatively coordinated coalition of fossil fuel companies  industry groups  conservative think tanks  and contrarian scientists   like the tobacco industry  the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about scientific data and results   many who deny  dismiss  or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change are labelled as  climate change skeptics   which several scientists have noted is a misnomer   there are different variants of climate denial  some deny that warming takes place at all  some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences  and some minimise the negative impacts of climate change   manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a manufactured controversy  creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes   strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions   and questioning the motives of individual scientists   an echo chamber of climate denying blogs and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change   climate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s   due to media coverage in the early 1990s  people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion   in popular culture  the climate fiction movie the day after tomorrow  2004  and the al gore documentary an inconvenient truth  2006  focused on climate change   significant regional  gender  age and political differences exist in both public concern for  and understanding of  climate change  more highly educated people  and in some countries  women and younger people  were more likely to see climate change as a serious threat   partisan gaps also exist in many countries   and countries with high co2 emissions tend to be less concerned   views on causes of climate change vary widely between countries   concern has increased over time   to the point where in 2021 a majority of citizens in many countries express a high level of worry about climate change  or view it as a global emergency   higher levels of worry are associated with stronger public support for policies that address climate change   climate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change  they can take the form of public demonstrations  fossil fuel divestment  lawsuits and other activities   prominent demonstrations include the school strike for climate  in this initiative  young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on fridays  inspired by swedish teenager greta thunberg   mass civil disobedience actions by groups like extinction rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport   litigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action from public institutions and companies  activists also initiate lawsuits which target governments and demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws on climate change   lawsuits against fossil fuel companies generally seek compensation for loss and damage   in the 1820s  joseph fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why earth s temperature was higher than the sun s energy alone could explain  earth s atmosphere is transparent to sunlight  so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat  however  the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface  and captures some of that heat  which in turn warms the planet   in 1856 eunice newton foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air  and that the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide  co2   she concluded that  an atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature       starting in 1859   john tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygen together totaling 99  of dry air are transparent to radiated heat  however  water vapour and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide absorb radiated heat and re radiate that heat into the atmosphere  tyndall proposed that changes in the concentrations of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past  including ice ages   svante arrhenius noted that water vapour in air continuously varied  but the co2 concentration in air was influenced by long term geological processes  warming from increased co2 levels would increase the amount of water vapour  amplifying warming in a positive feedback loop  in 1896  he published the first climate model of its kind  projecting that halving co2 levels could have produced a drop in temperature initiating an ice age  arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling co2 to be around 5 6  c   other scientists were initially skeptical and believed that the greenhouse effect was saturated so that adding more co2 would make no difference  and that the climate would be self regulating   beginning in 1938  guy stewart callendar published evidence that climate was warming and co2 levels were rising   but his calculations met the same objections   in the 1950s  gilbert plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum  this model predicted that increasing co2 levels would cause warming  around the same time  hans suess found evidence that co2 levels had been rising  and roger revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase  the two scientists subsequently helped charles keeling to begin a record of continued increase  which has been termed the  keeling curve    scientists alerted the public   and the dangers were highlighted at james hansen s 1988 congressional testimony   the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc   set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world s governments  spurred interdisciplinary research   as part of the ipcc reports  scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer reviewed journal articles   there is a near complete scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities  as of 2019  agreement in recent literature reached over 99     no scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view   consensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change  national science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions   the 2021 ipcc assessment report stated that it is  unequivocal  that climate change is caused by humans   fourth assessment report fifth assessment report  special report  global warming of 1 5  c special report  climate change and land special report  the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate sixth assessment report ']"
